# 10.1.6 Factorial

For this problem, you are going to write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. Remember, factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it. This function should be similar to the summing example we looked at earlier.

*Note: Make sure you enter small numbers to test. Factorial will overflow the int value very quickly!*
