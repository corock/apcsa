# 2.2.8 Instance Variables for Your Dog

Now we are going to use more instance variables. Here we have a class that represents a dog. Currently, the only instance variable (or field) is called `breed`. You can make a new Dog object by passing the `breed` to the constructor.

We want to add an instance variable that is a String called `name`, which represents the dogâ€™s name. Add the instance variable and also include it as the second parameter to the constructor.

Test out your Dog class in DogTester.java
