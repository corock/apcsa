# 2.2.6 Using the Rectangle Class

This program makes use of the `Rectangle` class from the previous example. It contains two files: `Rectangle.java` and `RectangleTester.java`.

You should add code to `RectangleTester.java` to create a rectangle with a width of 5 and height of 12 and then print out the object.
