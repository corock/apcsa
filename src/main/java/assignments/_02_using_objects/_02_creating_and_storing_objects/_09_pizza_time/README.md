# 2.2.9 Pizza Time!

In the previous lesson we asked you to think about what instance variables a pizza should have. Now in this problem, weâ€™re going to help you write the class.

### Instance Variables

The class should have three instance variables

- `private String type`
- `private String toppings`
- `private int size`

Add the instance variables, and then add the constructor as specified below.

### Constructor

It must have a constructor with the method signature

```java
Pizza(String theType, String theToppings, int theSize)
```

### Main

In your tester program you should create at least three different Pizza objects and print them out.

For example, your program might print

```bash
12 inch Veggie pizza with Tomatoes, onions, olives
15 inch Cheese pizza with Cheese
20 inch Meat pizza with Pepperoni, sausage, bacon
```
