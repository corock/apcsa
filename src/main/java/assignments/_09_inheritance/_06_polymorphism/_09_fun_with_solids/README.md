# 9.6.9 Fun with Solids

Given the `Solid` class, extend it with:

```text
Pyramid
Cylinder
RectangularPrism
Sphere
```

Make sure to create the constructor and override the `volume` and `surfaceArea` methods.

Also extend RectangularPrism with Cube.

**Note:** The pyramid should be a rectangular pyramid.

**HINT:** You can look up formulas for how to compute the volume and surface area of a certain type of shape online.
